BiggerTrak

This is the source code that is used for my PiWars 2014 entry 'BiggerTrak'.
BiggerTrak was based around a Wild Thumper 6WD Chassis with the TRex Motor Controller
(Arduino based) connected to a Raspberry Pi Model A+ via I2C.

Remote control of the robot was done via a Sony PlayStation DualShock controller, connected via BlueTooth 
to the Raspberry Pi.

Automated control of the robot was started, but currently it doesn't reliably drive in a straight line and still needs work.
